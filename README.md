# Superstore-Retail---Looker-Studio
This project involves building a 2-page (1600x1600) interactive dashboard using Google Looker Studio, analyzing sales and shipping performance for a retail company named Superstore with over 15,000 rows of data spanning 2020–2023. The objective is to extract actionable insights that support marketing, logistics, and operational strategies through data-driven storytelling.

 Key Business Insights:
📦 Sales Trends – Used drill-down views by geography, time, product, and customer segment to uncover sales patterns across different product lines, audiences, and time periods.
💸 Sales Segmentation – Identified which product lines and regions consistently deliver strong returns, and flagged those with longer delivery times or high return rates.
🚚 Shipping Bottlenecks – Analyzed average delivery time across shipping modes and profit segments, then visualized delay concentrations at the city level.
🔁 Returns Analysis – Blended datasets and applied custom logic to accurately calculate and track return rates at the order level.

Skills Demonstrated: 
📈 Segmented Visual Analysis --> Applied dynamic grouping logic across all visual types — bar charts, scorecards, stacked bars, pivot tables, and geo maps — to enable consistent, multi-dimensional comparisons.

🔗 Data Integration & Blending --> Combined datasets to create a unified model for returned orders and shipping calculations, enhancing metric accuracy.

🧠 Calculated Field with SQL Queries --> Used queries like CASE WHEN, IF, COUNT, CONTAINS_TEXT, and DATE_DIFF to create dimensions for Profit Margin Group, Return Status, and Shipping Delay Classification.

📊 Custom Business Metrics --> Developed key indicators such as Average Order Value, Shipping Delay Rate, and Target Gap Tracking (e.g., measuring deviation from 10% shipping time reduction goals).

🧩 Custom Grouping & Binning --> Implemented profit segment bins as both dimensions and metrics to support sorting, filtering, and layered analysis.

🌍 Geo Mapping & Heatmaps --> Visualized sales and delays across U.S. cities with bubble sizes and heat intensity to pinpoint high-performing or at-risk areas.

🎨 Conditional Formatting --> Used in tables and pivot charts to emphasize late shipments, excessive discounts, or underperforming segments.

⚙️ Parameters for dynamic goal setting --> Explored predicitve analytics by setting customizeable targets for future sale values and average shipping time for each mode.
